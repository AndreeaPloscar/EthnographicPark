# EthnographicPark

This is an application for the organisation of an ethnographic park, developed in C++.
It manages the ethnologists and the buildings. 
It is a GUI based application using QT Framework. 
When started, a new window is opened for each ethnologist, where the buildings are displayed in a customized way for him. 
He can add and update the buildings from his thematic area. When a modification is made by one ethnologist, everyone sees it. 
A separate window shows the plan of the park with sectors. 
Buildings are colored corresponding to each sector and the window is also updated after each modification.
